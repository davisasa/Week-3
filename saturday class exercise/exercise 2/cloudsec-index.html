        <h1>Cloud security</h1>

        <p>
            Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed to address external and internal threats to business security. Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and services as part of their infrastructure.
<br><br>
The terms digital transformation and cloud migration have been used regularly in enterprise settings over recent years. While both phrases can mean different things to different organizations, each is driven by a common denominator: the need for change.
<br><br>
As enterprises embrace these concepts and move toward optimizing their operational approach, new challenges arise when balancing productivity levels and security. While more modern technologies help organizations advance capabilities outside the confines of on-premise infrastructure, transitioning primarily to cloud-based environments can have several implications if not done securely.
<br><br>
Striking the right balance requires an understanding of how modern-day enterprises can benefit from the use of interconnected cloud technologies while deploying the best cloud security practices.

        <h1>Challenges of Cloud Security</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Lack of visibility</h2>
It's easy to lose track of how your data is being accessed and by whom, since many cloud services are accessed outside of corporate networks and through third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Multitenancy</h2>
Public cloud environments house multiple client infrastructures under the same umbrella, so it's possible your hosted services can get compromised by malicious attackers as collateral damage when targeting other businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Access management and shadow IT</h2>
While enterprises may be able to successfully manage and restrict access points across on-premises systems, administering these same levels of restrictions can be challenging in cloud environments. This can be dangerous for organizations that don't deploy bring-your-own device (BYOD) policies and allow unfiltered access to cloud services from any device or geolocation.
        </p>

        <h1>Types of Cloud Security Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Identity and access management (IAM)</h2>
        <p>
            Identity and access management (IAM) tools and services allow enterprises to deploy policy-driven enforcement protocols for all users attempting to access both on-premises and cloud-based services. The core functionality of IAM is to create digital identities for all users so they can be actively monitored and restricted when necessary during all data interactions
        </p>

        <h2>Data loss prevention (DLP)</h2>
        <p>
            Data loss prevention (DLP) services offer a set of tools and services designed to ensure the security of regulated cloud data. DLP solutions use a combination of remediation alerts, data encryption, and other preventative measures to protect all stored data, whether at rest or in motion.
        </p>

        <h2>Security information and event management (SIEM)</h2>
        <p>
            Security information and event management (SIEM) provides a comprehensive security orchestration solution that automates threat monitoring, detection, and response in cloud-based environments. Using artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies to correlate log data across multiple platforms and digital assets, SIEM technology gives IT teams the ability to successfully apply their network security protocols while being able to quickly react to any potential threats.
